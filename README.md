# **Webpage Essentials**

## Introduction

If you've just started working on your own webpage, have used templates to create your webpage or created a website using Microsoft's Visual Studio, you would have noticed that the websites tend to use a lot of stylesheets and javascripts. While they have their uses, they are a nightmare to go though and sometimes the slightest editing of any of the scripts and/or stylesheets can cause the entire page/site to develop serious flaws in its appearance and/or behaviour.

As a developer who has encountered this problem and several others, I created this repository which will provide the tips and tricks that I encountered and utilized that can help to avoid this problem without negatively affecting the performance, functionality and visuals of the webpage/site that you're developing.
